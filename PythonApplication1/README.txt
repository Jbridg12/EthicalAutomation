COSC423: Ethical Automation

Overview:

The Ethical Automation included in this project submission implements four checks that evaluate indivicual aspects of an applicants grades, stored in a file "applicants.csv", and stores the results of these evaluations in a file "results.csv".

Execution:

To run the code simply make sure the "applicants.csv" is located in the project directory and run the "main.py" program. The results will theen appear in a "results.csv" file in the project directory.

Comment on Ethics:

This is a very simple implementation of automation and it already brings up an interesting point about the ethical risks. Having automated software sweep the criteria will eliminate the chance of good hires that fall outside of those specifications, since theres more to each applicant than these six scores. It could be extremely efficient if eventually the criteria was all fair and ecompassed more about humans than grades. However, working with these sorts of categorization automation is difficult because there is high susceptability to bias and the designer's own prejudices.
